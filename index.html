            for over half its history Christianity’s geographic center was not Rome,

        <p>Timothy I is arguably one of the most
          successful patriarchs of the Church of
          the East, an Eastern Christian Church
          of the East Syriac Rite. During his time
          in Baghdad,Timothy sent hundreds
          of letters to Christians throughout the
          Middle East, Central Asia, and India. The
          Church of Baghdad focuses on Timothy’s
          400 pages of epistles that might help
          readers understand his influence in the
          ancient religious landscape. By using
          social network analysis (SNA), the process
          of investigating social structures through
          the use of networks and graph theory, we
          can blueprint the early Christian religious
          influence in the Muslim city of Baghdad.
          My work in this project was two-fold:
          visualizing interactions between Timothy
          and other members of the Church of the
          East during the ninth century and creating
          literature reviews on relevant social network
          analysis (SNA) articles for future research.</p>
        <p>
          My primary task was to create visualizations
          of Timothy’s epistolary networks. Previous
          Research Interns on this project had built
          a database to catalog the interactions
          between Timothy I and his letter-receivers.
          My job was to utilize this database to
          create graphs. After finishing self-guided
          online tutorials on Cytoscape, Gephi, and
          Adobe Illustrator, I experimented with
          different artistic styles and finalized graphs
          that display the interactions between
          Timothy and the recipients of his letters.
          For instance, one of these graphs illustrates
          the disproportionate representation of
          Sergius, one of the most important letter
          recipients, in the extant letters.

          This serves as a contrast to the relatively
          evenly distributed letter-recipient
          network of other leaders of the East
          Syrian Church in Christian history, including
          Patriarch Isho’yahb III.

        <p>The Church of Baghdad Project explores
          the expansion of Medieval Christianity in

          the Middle East through a close examina-
          tion of Timothy I’s 60 or so epistles. My

          primary task was to use mapping software
          to visually assist the readers in grasping the
          extent of the Church of the East through
          the transactions of Timothy I’s letters. I also
          carried out data analysis and visualization
          tasks, such as comparing the distribution

          of 1000+ Syriac manuscripts stored in mul-
          tiple libraries around the world and finding

          trends in the word count of Timothy’s let-
          ters. In addition, I spent several hours per

          week creating a literature review, finding
          papers and articles about spatial history
          that helped drive our methodologies.</p>
        <p>Previous research interns have accumulated
          datasets of Timothy I’s letter movements,

          including the starting points and destina-
          tions, the number of interactions between

          each combination of cities, and the number
          of mentions for each city. I modified and
          occasionally acquired new coordinates for
          each location and calculated its distance
          from Baghdad, Timothy’s location, using

          the Haversine formula in Python. This pre-
          pared the foundation for the mapping proj-
          ect. I used QGIS for most of the maps ex-
          cept for a single map that I produced using

          ArcGIS Online. Precise modifications, label-
          ing, and coloring were done with Adobe

          Illustrator. In order to simplify the maps and
          draw readers’ attention to our topic, I used

          a simple base map with no political bound-
          aries or topography and minimal labeling.

          I conducted additional data analysis and
          visualizations mainly through Tableau.</p>
        <p>One mode was library comparison. Because
          thousands of Syriac manuscripts are distrib-
          uted among several libraries worldwide, it
          can be difficult for researchers to identify
          which library holds the manuscripts they are
          interested in studying. By sorting the trends
          of manuscripts stored in each library, such
          as their age, size, and genre, I provided
          data visualizations that can assist research-
          ers in the search for materials.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">This plot indicates how different materials are used for Syriac manuscripts in 3 different
            libraries. With this and several other plots by different classifications, scholars can grasp the

            aggregation of manuscript data.

            much more centralized region of the medieval Middle East.
